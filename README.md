# Monopoly

University project in a 3-man team involving:
- Requirements analysis
- Use case analysis
- Class analysis & design
- State and sequence diagrams
- Implementation of a prototype in C#
- Testing and documentation
- Final report and presentation

The topic of the project was chosen by the students, who decided to design and implement a 2D version of the Monopoly board game, using the .NET environment and Windows Forms.

The resulting prototype can be run using .NET 3.5 framework onwards, by simply opening the "Monopoli" project and compiling it.
The game allows the user to set up and customize the game settings, including images, names, colors and more. This can be done by editing the config.xml file inside the Resources folder of the project. Custom resources can be used by placing them in the same folder.
